# Learning Hardware and Electronics

**Why am I doing this?**

 My ex dumped me because I didn’t know shit about LTUs, transistors, ICs, or hardware in general. Yeah, that was a tough pill to swallow. Now I’m teaching myself this shit. 


**What am I learning?**

- **LTUs (Logic Transistor Units):** The magic behind how small switches create logic. Don’t worry, I didn’t get it either at first.
- **Transistors:** These little bastards control electricity. It’s like a light switch for computers. And, apparently, they’re in everything.
- **ICs (Integrated Circuits):** A bunch of transistors jammed together to do some real work. Kinda like the brain of a circuit.
- **Hardware in General:** From basic sensors to microcontrollers, and eventually, I’ll get my hands on FPGAs and maybe even make my own damn circuits.

**Why should you give a shit?**

If you’re struggling with the same crap or just want to follow along as I get my head around this hardware nonsense, feel free to hang out. Maybe you’ll learn something. Maybe I’ll learn something. Either way, we’re all just figuring it out together. Don’t be afraid to drop feedback or jump in.
