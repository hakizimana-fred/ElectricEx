# Transistors

Imagine a transistor as a small electronic switch. It can turn electricity on or off, just like a light switch in your home. But instead of flipping it with your hand, itâ€™s controlled by a tiny signal.

There are two main "modes" of a transistor:

- **OFF** (electricity can't flow)
- **ON** (electricity flows like water through a pipe)

These tiny switches can be combined to create logic, like deciding when to turn a light on or off based on certain rules. They're like the tiny workers inside all computers and devices!
